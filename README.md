**Spring JDBC Example**

This repository demonstrates how to use **Spring JDBC** for database operations in a Spring-based Java application. It includes configurations, DAO implementations, and examples of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using `JdbcTemplate`. The project showcases:

* Spring JDBC setup with XML or Java-based configuration
* Integration with MySQL/PostgreSQL (or your preferred database)
* Use of `JdbcTemplate` and `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate`
* DAO layer design pattern
* Exception handling using Spring's `DataAccessException`

Ideal for developers looking to understand Spring's abstraction over JDBC and build efficient, lightweight data access layers.
